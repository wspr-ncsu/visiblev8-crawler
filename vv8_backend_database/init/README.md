# Postgresql initial configuration

This directory hosts the initial table configuration for the parsers and the vv8 backend. The files here should not be modified unless you absolutely (and I mean absolutely) know what you are doing. All incremental changes should be made to the `backend/database_models` folder and update scripts should be generated using the associated alembic configuration.
